Coqui STT nodejs binding usage examples

Coqui STT runtime transcript NodeJs native client.
Some examples and tests. 

## What's Coqui STT?

[Coqui STT](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT) is an open-source Speech-To-Text engine.
Documentation for installation, usage, and training models are available on [Coqui STT documentation](https://stt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Coqui STT run-time transcript, using NodeJs

You want to access Coqui STT speech to text runtime transcription from a well formatted WAV file, using NodeJs.
I tested two options:

1. Spawning, from your NodeJs main thread, an external Coqui STT command line program.
   That's the simplest, dumb and slow way in terms of performances.
   In general, spawning an external process, catching his stdout is a trivial approach, 
   but applicable all times you do not have better inter process communication options. 

   Example: [deepSpeechTranscriptSpawn.js](deepSpeechTranscriptSpawn.js).

2. Using Coqui STT native NodeJs client interface. 
   That's a more performant way.
 
   Example: [deepSpeechTranscriptNative.js](deepSpeechTranscriptNative.js).
 
   The example is very raugh, presuming the audio file is a "well formatted" WAV file. 
   The audio file is just read in memory and the deepspeech `model.stt()` API is called.
   [Official examples](https://github.com/mozilla/Coqui STT-examples#javascript) repo
   contains audio examples that show how to validate WAV, 
   and speeech processing from streaming / in-memory buffers.

### Coqui STT official native NodeJs API

- [API Documentation](https://stt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NodeJS-API.html)
- [Usage Examples](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT-examples#javascript)

### Wat's a well formatted WAV audio file?

Coqui STT requires a 16bit 16 KHz mono WAV input audio file.
To record such a file:
```
sudo apt install sox
sudo apt install mediainfo

rec -f S16_BE -r 16000 -c 1 my_recording.wav

mediainfo my_recording.wav
General
Complete name                            : my_recording.wav

Sampling rate                            : 16.0 kHz

   $ python3 -m pip install -U pip
   $ python3 -m pip install stt

   # Download üê∏'s pre-trained English models
   $ curl -LO https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/releases/download/v0.9.3/coqui-stt-0.9.3-models.pbmm
   $ curl -LO https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/releases/download/v0.9.3/coqui-stt-0.9.3-models.scorer

   # Download some example audio files
   $ curl -LO https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/releases/download/v0.9.3/audio-0.9.3.tar.gz
   $ tar -xvf audio-0.9.3.tar.gz

   # Transcribe an audio file
   $ stt --model coqui-stt-0.9.3-models.pbmm --scorer coqui-stt-0.9.3-models.scorer --audio audio/2830-3980-0043.wav
   ```

2. Install this repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://solyarisoftware/deepspeeechjs && cd deepspeeechjs
   ```

3. Install the official Coqui STT npm package
   ```bash
   npm install deepspeech
   ```

## Run the test

The bash script `test_elapsed.sh` compares elapsed times 
of transcript of the audio file `./audio/4507-16021-0012.wav` 
(corresponding to text *why should one halt on the way*), in 3 cases:

- using a bash script running the CLI `deepspeech` official client [deepspeech_cli.sh](deepspeech_cli.sh) 
- using the nodejs "spawn" client [deepSpeechTranscriptSpawn.js](deepSpeechTranscriptSpawn.js)
- using the nodejs native client [deepSpeechTranscriptNative.js](deepSpeechTranscriptNative.js)

```
(deepspeech-venv) $ test_elapsed.sh
```
```

As expected, the native client transcript elapsed time (1553ms), is much better than the spawn client (1832ms).

## Disclaimer 

IMPORTANT: unfortunately npm package `deepspeech` cause a crash using node version 16.0.0.
See [issue](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3642).
To run this project you have to downgrade installed Node version. 
By example I had success with Node version 14.16.1.


## Changelog

- 0.0.1 test script testPerformances.sh improved


## To do

- The project is in a very draft stage.
- Add a better high-level API interface. E.g. including metadata as parameters
- Add a (web) server architectue. 
  See: [How to use DeepSpeech for a text-to-speech server (in NodeJs)](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/how-to-use-deepspeech-for-a-text-to-speech-server-in-nodejs/79636/2)
